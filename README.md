Puzzle game on 2D platform
Constant routine analysis with “starting point” and “ending point” changing to find my twin brother
Prototype Description:
	I want to find my twin brother cuz I don’t want to be all alone :(. Yet it takes a long journey to make my dream come true. I have to go over different layers with ladders and bypass the blocking walls to reach the destination. Along the journey to find my twin brother, I “grow up” by accumulating “relevant experience” and switch to “different lifestyles” to “fit in”. Eventually, I realize what I am longing for is, someone “the SAME” to me.
